= Concatenate clauses

In most cases, clauses can be concatenated by using chained methods, for example:

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.Match(myPattern).return(myNode);
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(this0)
RETURN this0
----

However, in some cases, clauses may need to be manually concatenated. 
This may be caused by:

* Chained methods not being available.
* Dynamic number of clauses in a query.
* Composite clauses that have been generated separately.
* Using `Cypher.Raw`

For these cases, the helper utility `Cypher.utils.concat` can be used. 
This function accepts any number of clauses and concatenates them in the provided order. 
For instance, the previous example could be written as:

[source, javascript]
----
const matchClause = new Cypher.Match(myPattern);
const returnClause = new Cypher.Return(myNode);

const clause = Cypher.utils.concat(matchClause, returnClause);
----

The resulting Cypher will be identical to the first example:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(this0)
RETURN this0
----


`Cypher.utils.concat` can also be used to merge multiple clauses dynamically:

[source, javascript]
----
const match1 = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Node());
const match2 = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Node());
const match3 = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Node());

const clauses = [match1, match2, match3]

const clause = Cypher.utils.concat(...clauses);
----

Additionally, `utils.concat` also accepts `undefined` and, in this case, those values will be ignored. 
The following example will produce the same Cypher as before: 

[source, javascript]
----
const clauses = [match1, match2, undefined, match3]

const clause = Cypher.utils.concat(...clauses);
----

Note that `Cypher.utils.concat` accepts any clause and does not ensure that the resulting Cypher will be valid.


[WARNING]
====
It is not possible to pass the same clause twice to `Cypher.utils.concat`.
Make sure that every clause is a different instance of a Cypher Builder clause.
