= Conditional Expressions (CASE)

This page describes how to create link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/queries/case/[`CASE`] expressions in Cypher with Cypher Builder.


== Simple CASE

THe simple `CASE` form compares a single expressions against multiple values. It can be constructed with the `Case` class by passing the expression to be compared the constructor:


[source, javascript]
----
const person = new Cypher.Node();
new Cypher.Case(person.property("eyes"))
    .when(new Cypher.Literal("blue")).then(new Cypher.Literal(1))
    .when(new Cypher.Literal("brown"), new Cypher.Literal("hazel")).then(new Cypher.Literal(2))
    .else(new Cypher.Literal(3))
----

The resulting Cypher, note that `END` is added automatically:

[source, cypher]
----
CASE n.eyes
  WHEN 'blue'  THEN 1
  WHEN 'brown', 'hazel' THEN 2
  ELSE 3
END
----
