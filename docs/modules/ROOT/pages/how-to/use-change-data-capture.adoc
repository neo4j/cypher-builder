= Use Change Data Capture

link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cdc/current/[Change Data Capture] (CDC) queries can be created with the Cypher Builder by using the Procedures in the `cdc` namespace:

* `Cypher.db.cdc.current()`
* `Cypher.db.cdc.earliest()`
* `Cypher.db.cdc.query(from, selectors)`

[WARNING]
====
Previous to Neo4j version 5.17, the namespace for cdc procedures is `cdc.x` instead of `db.cdc.x`, this namespace is available in Cypher Builder through the deprecated functions `Cypher.cdc.x`
====

== Examples

=== Acquiring the current change identifier

In order to query changes, you need to acquire a change identifier. This can be done with `cdc.current()` or `cdc.earliest()`. To acquire the latest change identifier, follow these instructions:

[source, javascript]
----
const query = Cypher.db.cdc.current().yield("id");
const { cypher } = query.build();
----


[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.current() YIELD id
----


=== Querying changes

To query changes in the graph, follow these instructions:

[source, javascript]
----
const query = Cypher.db.cdc.query(fromId);
const { cypher } = query.build();
----

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query("cdc-id", [])
----


=== Using query selectors

To use link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cdc/current/selectors/[CDC selectors] you'll need to define a `Map` with the properties of the selector schema for each selector:

[source, javascript]
----
const fromId="cdc-id";
const selector = new Cypher.Map({
    select: new Cypher.Literal("e"),
    operation: new Cypher.Literal("c"),
    changesTo: new Cypher.List([new Cypher.Literal("name"), new Cypher.Literal("title")]),
});


const query = Cypher.db.cdc.query(fromId, [selector]);
const { cypher } = query.build();
----

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query("cdc-id", [{
    select: "e",
    operation: "c",
    changesTo: ["name", "title"]
}])
----
