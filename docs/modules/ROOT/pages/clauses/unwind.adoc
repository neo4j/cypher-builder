This page describes how to create a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/unwind/[`UNWIND`] clause with the `Cypher.Unwind` class.

To create an `Unwind` clause, pass a tuple of a variable or expression and its alias to `new Cypher.Unwind`:


[source, javascript]
----
const val = new Cypher.Variable()
const unwindClause = new Cypher.Unwind([new Cypher.Param([1,2]), val]).return([val, "result"])

const { cypher, params } = unwindClause.build()
----

This generates the following `UNWIND` clause:

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND $param0 AS var0
RETURN var0 AS result
----
