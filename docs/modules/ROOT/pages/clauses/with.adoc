= With

This page describes how to create a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/with/[`WITH`] clause using the `Cypher.With` class. Note that this is different to the xref:../subqueries/call.adoc#_importwith[ImportWith] statement inside `CALL`.

A `With` clause will take multiple parameters. Variables can be passed directly without aliasing:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node();
const withClause = new Cypher.With(movie);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH this0
----


== Aliasing

Any expression can be passed to `With` and aliased to a `Variable` to be used later in the query by passing a tuple of an expression and the aliaed variable:

[source, javascript]
----
const variable = new Cypher.Variable();
new Cypher.With([new Cypher.Literal("Hello"), variable]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH "Hello" AS var0
----

A string can be used directly as the alias value, when the name is already known.

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.With([new Cypher.Literal("Hello"), "myVar"]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH "Hello" AS myVar
----

== Wildcard


`With` accepts the string `"*"` to add a wildcard to carry over all existing variables. This parameter cannot be aliased, and will always be added at the beginning of the `WITH` statement:


[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.With("*", [movieNode, "result"]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH *, this0 AS result
----
