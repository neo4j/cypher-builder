= With

This page describes how to create a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/with/[`WITH`] clause using the `Cypher.With` class.

A `With` clause takes multiple parameters.
Pass variables directly without aliasing:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node();
const withClause = new Cypher.With(movie);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH this0
----


== Aliasing

You can pass any expression to `With` and alias it to a `Variable` to use it later in the query by passing a tuple of an expression and the aliased variable:

[source, javascript]
----
const variable = new Cypher.Variable();
new Cypher.With([new Cypher.Literal("Hello"), variable]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH "Hello" AS var0
----

Use a string as the alias value if you already know the name:

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.With([new Cypher.Literal("Hello"), "myVar"]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH "Hello" AS myVar
----


== Wildcard

`With` accepts the string `"*"` to add a wildcard to carry over all existing variables.
This parameter cannot be aliased, and is always added at the beginning of the `WITH` statement:


[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.With("*", [movieNode, "result"]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH *, this0 AS result
----
