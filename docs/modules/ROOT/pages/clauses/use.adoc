= Use

This page describes how to create a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/use/[`USE`] clause with the `Cypher.Use` class.

To create an `Use` clause, pass an existing query to `Cypher.use` to prepend a `USE` statement before the query:


[source, javascript]
----
const n = new Cypher.Node();
const query = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Pattern(n, { labels: ["Movie"] })).return(n);

const useQuery = new Cypher.Use("mydb", query);
----

This generates the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
USE mydb
MATCH (this0:Movie)
RETURN this0
----
