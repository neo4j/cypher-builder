= Variables and parameters

This page shows how to use variables and parameters with Cypher Builder.

== Variables

Variables can be used in Cypher to reference parts of a pattern and hold values.
For example:

----Cypher
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m
----

The variable `m` refers to a node matched in the pattern `(:Movie)`. 
The node is then returned.

[NOTE]
====
Writing dynamic Cypher queries can be challenging as the resulting variables need to have unique names that correctly reference the values.
In Cypher Builder, JavaScript references remove the need to track variable names, thus providing another layer of abstraction.
====

=== Types

Cypher Builder distinguishes four types of variables:

* `Node`: holds a reference to a node matched in a pattern.
* `Relationship`: holds a reference to a relationship in a pattern.
* `Variable`: generic variable reference.
* `Path`: a variable to hold a path.

[NOTE]
====
All Cypher Builder variables are virtual references to a Cypher variable that will be translated to a unique name.
====

=== Defining a variable

An arbitrary Cypher variable can be defined with:

[source, javascript]
----
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
----

This variable can then be used as an expression in any clause that supports variables, for instance:

[source, javascript]
----
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const query = new Cypher.Return(myVar)
----

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN var0
----

The name `var0` is automatically generated when `.build()` is called to prevent name collision. 
If the variable is reused, the same name will be used in the generated Cypher, for instance:

[source, javascript]
----
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const query = new Cypher.With(myVar).return(myVar);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH var0
RETURN var0
----

Each instance you create of a variable is associated with a different name:

[source, javascript]
----
const withVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const returnVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const query = new Cypher.With(withVar).return(returnVar);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH var0
RETURN var1
----

=== Nodes and relationships

Nodes and relationships are variables holding extra data on nodes and relationships.
They can be used in xref:patterns.adoc[Patterns], for example:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({labels: ["Movie"]});
const relationship = new Cypher.Relationship({type: "ACTED_IN"});

const pattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movie).related(relationship).to();
const match = new Cypher.Match(pattern).return(movie);
----

----Cypher
MATCH (this0:Movie)-[this1:ACTED_IN]->(this2)
RETURN this0
----

In this example, the node variable `movie` is created and then used in the `MATCH` and `RETURN` clauses.

In the translated Cypher, you can see how the node variable is translated to the Cypher variable `this0`, while the relationship is assigned to `this1`. 

These names are not defined in your JavaScript code, but are automatically generated when the query is built with `.build()`. 
The labels and type passed to `Node` and `Relationship` variables are used in the pattern.

Parameter that can be passed to a `Node` class:

* `labels`: an array containing the labels of that node.

Parameters that can be passed to a Relationship:

* `type`: a string with the type of the relationship.


==== Escaping labels and types

Labels and types will be automatically escaped if any uncommon character is detected. 
For example:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({labels: ["My Movie"]});
const match = new Cypher.Match(movie).return(movie);
----

----Cypher
MATCH (this0:`My Movie`)
RETURN this0
----

Note that `My Movie` is being surrounded in quotes to prevent code injection with dynamic labels.

=== Path

Path variables can be used for path assignment in patterns, for example:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p0 = (this1)-[this2:ACTED_IN]->(this3)
RETURN p0
----

To assign a path variable, use the method `.assignToPath` in the relevant clause and pass a `new Path()` instance:

[source, javascript]
----
const path = new Cypher.Path();

const query = new Cypher.Match(pattern).assignToPath(path).return(path);
----


=== Named variables

By default, variables do not have a name; a unique name/id is generated at build time to avoid collisions.
However, in some cases, you may want to generate a query with a specific name. 
To do this, all variable types must have a counterpart _named_ class:

* `NamedVariable`
* `NamedNode`
* `NamedRelationship`
* `NamedPath`

These can be used in the same fashion as normal variables, but a name must be provided when creating them:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.NamedNode("n", {labels: ["Movie"]});
const match = new Cypher.Match(movie).return(movie);
----

----Cypher
MATCH (n:Movie)
RETURN n
----

== Property

Variables such as nodes or maps may contain properties. 
To access these properties in the generated Cypher, you can use the method `.property` on variables:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({labels: ["Movie"]})
const query = new Cypher.Match(movie).return(movie.property("title"));
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(this0:Movie)
RETURN this0.title
----

=== Nested properties

Nested properties can also be accessed either by passing multiple parameters or concatenating calls to `.property`:

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.Variable().property("movie", "title");
new Cypher.Variable().property("movie").property("title")
----

In both cases, the resulting Cypher should look like this:

[source, cypher]
----
var0.movie.title
----

=== Expressions

Expressions can also be used as a property key to dynamically access properties:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({labels: ["Movie"]})

const movieProperty = movie.property(Cypher.plus(new Cypher.Param("ti"), new Cypher.Literal("tle")))
const query = new Cypher.Match(movie).return(movieProperty);
----

The query automatically adds square brackets (`[]`) notation to safely execute the expression:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(this0:Movie)
RETURN this0[($param0 + $param1)]
----

=== Index

Like properties, an index can also be accessed through the method `.index`:

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.Variable().index(2);
----

[source, cypher]
----
var0[2]
----

== Parameters

Another common challenge with dynamic queries is keeping track of parameters. 
To solve this, you can use the class `Param` to create Cypher Builder parameters.

Parameters behave similarly to variables, however, they contain a defined value that will automatically be returned as part of the parameters when the `.build()` method is called.
For example:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] });
const titleProp = movie.property(movie);

const query = new Cypher.Match(movie).where(Cypher.eq(titleProp, new Cypher.Param("The Matrix")));

const { cypher, params } = query.build();
----

Returns the following Cypher:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)
WHERE this0[this0] = $param0
----

And the following parameters object:

[source, javascript]
----
{
    param0: "The Matrix"
}
----

Parameters can also be reused, like variables:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] });
const titleProp = movie.property(movie);
const titleParam = new Cypher.Param("The Matrix");

const query = new Cypher.Match(movie).where(Cypher.eq(titleProp, titleParam)).return(titleParam);

const {cypher, params} = query.build();
----

_Cypher_
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)
WHERE this0[this0] = $param0
RETURN this0, $param0
----

_Params_
[source, javascript]
----
{
    param0: "The Matrix"
}
----

In such cases, Cypher Builder provides a name to the parameter and correctly links it to the `Param` object.

Note that if two instances of `Param` are used, then two separate parameters should be returned, regardless of the value.
For example:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] });
const titleProp = movie.property(movie);
const titleParam1 = new Cypher.Param("The Matrix");
const titleParam2 = new Cypher.Param("The Matrix")

const query = new Cypher.Match(movie).where(Cypher.eq(titleProp, titleParam1)).return(titleParam2);

const {cypher, params} = query.build();
----

_Cypher_
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)
WHERE this0[this0] = $param0
RETURN this0, $param0
----

_Params_
[source, javascript]
----
{
    param0: "The Matrix"
}
----

== Literal

Literal values can be defined with `Cypher.Literal`. 
Literals behave like parameters, but they will inject the value provided directly into the Cypher, serializing it as needed.
For instance:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] });
const titleProp = movie.property(movie);
const titleLiteral = new Cypher.Literal("The Matrix")

const query = new Cypher.Match(movie).where(Cypher.eq(titleProp, titleParam)).return(titleParam);

const {cypher, params} = query.build();
----

_Cypher_
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)
WHERE this0[this0] = "The Matrix"
RETURN this0, "The Matrix"
----

_Params_
[source, javascript]
----
{ }
----

Note how the value `The Matrix` is not injected directly, but correctly serialized to a string in Cypher. 
The following values are supported by `Literal`:

* String: `Cypher.Literal("Hello")` -> `"Hello"`
* Number: `Cypher.Literal(5)` -> `5`
* Boolean: `Cypher.Literal(true)` -> `true`
* Array: `Cypher.Literal([5, "Hello"])` -> `[5, "Hello"]`
* Null: `Cypher.Literal(null)` -> `NULL`


[NOTE]
====
Literals do not escape the values and code injection is a risk. 
It is generally recommended to use `Cypher.Param` instead.
====

=== `NULL`

As a shortcut for `new Cypher.Literal(null)`, the constant `Cypher.Null` is available. 
This will be translated to `NULL`:

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.Return(Cypher.Null)
----

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN NULL
----

== Aliasing
// Maybe aliasing can be moved to a how-to guide
Variables are commonly used for aliasing in a `WITH` or `RETURN` statement. 
To do that, you need to pass a tuple of the value and its alias.

=== Aliasing to a string

[source, javascript]
----
const node = new Cypher.Node({
    labels: ["Movie"],
});
const withQuery = new Cypher.With([node, "my-alias"]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH this0 AS my-alias
----

=== Aliasing to a variable

Instead of an exact string, you can alias to a `Cypher.Variable` so it can be reused as any other variable:

[source, javascript]
----
const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] });
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const match = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).with([movieNode, myVar]).return([myVar, "Film"]);
----

----
MATCH (this0:`Movie`)
WITH this0 AS var1
RETURN var1 AS Film 
----

In the previous example, after a `MATCH` the node variable `this0` is aliased to a variable with an arbitrary name (`var1`) in a `WITH` statement. 
Finally, in the `RETURN` the variable is aliased to the specific name `Film` that will be returned.
