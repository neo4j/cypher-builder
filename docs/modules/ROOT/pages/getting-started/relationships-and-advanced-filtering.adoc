= Relationships and advanced filtering

This tutorial shows how to add relationships and more advanced filters, as well as alias the results of the projection.
It extends the Cypher query example from the xref:getting-started/filters-and-projections.adoc[Filters and projections] tutorial and the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/example-data/#built-in-examples[Movies Dataset].

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(m:Movie)<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person)
WHERE (a.name="Keanu Reeves" AND (NOT(m.title CONTAINS "Matrix") OR m.released < 2000))
RETURN m.title, m.tagline, m.released, r.roles AS actingRoles
----

This query matches a `Movie` along with its actors. 
It should only return movies with the actor `Keanu Reeves`, excluding any movie with a title containing `Matrix` released after 1999.
It also adds the property `roles` from the relationship to the projection, aliasing it to `actingRoles`.

Querying it on the Movies Dataset should prompt this result:

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="4*<m"]
|===
| m.title | m.tagline | m.released | actingRoles
| "The Matrix" | "Welcome to the Real World" | 1999 | ["Neo"] 
| "Johnny Mnemonic" | "The hottest data on earth. In the coolest head in town" | 1995 | ["Johnny Mnemonic"] 
| "Something's Gotta Give" | null | 2003 | ["Julian Mercer"] 
| "The Devil's Advocate" | "Evil has its winning ways" | 1997 | ["Kevin Lomax"] 
| "The Replacements" | "Pain heals, Chicks dig scars... Glory lasts forever" | 2000 | ["Shane Falco"]
|===

Though the `Cypher.Match` statement accepts a `Cypher.Node` variable, this is a shorthand for very simple queries involving a single node. 
For more complex `MATCH` statements, like the one in this tutorial, you should define a *Pattern* when establishing relationships.

== Pattern creation

These are the steps you should follow to define a pattern:

. Define the elements of the pattern. 
Relationships, just like nodes, are variables that can be created and reused across your query:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const actedIn = new Cypher.Relationship({
    type: "ACTED_IN",
});

const personNode = new Cypher.Node({
    labels: ["Person"],
});
----
+
So far, the relationship is not connected to the nodes. 
This is because here you are creating a variable to hold the relationship matched by the pattern, not the relationship itself.

. Now use `new Cypher.Pattern` to define an arbitrarily complex pattern with the variables already declared:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const pattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movieNode).related(actedIn).to(personNode);
----
+
Note that, in Cypher Builder, patterns work similarly to Cypher, with each element of the chain being either a relationship or a node.

. Switch the `movieNode` variable for the `pattern` in the `MATCH` clause:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const clause = new Cypher.Match(pattern)
----

. Run the script.
You should get the following Cypher:
+ 
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)-[this1:ACTED_IN]->(this2:Person)
WHERE (this0.title = $param0 AND this0.released < $param1)
RETURN this0.title, this0.tagline, this0.released
----
+
[source, javascript]
----
{ param0: 'The Matrix', param1: 2000 }
----

For more information about creating patterns, refer to xref:patterns.adoc[Patterns].

=== Cardinality, direction, and properties

Despite changing the `MATCH` target in the previous steps, all the filters and relationships featured in the query are still pointing towards the correct variable: `this0`. 
However, the pattern is incorrect -- instead of returning a `Person` acting in a `Movie`, there is a `Movie` acting on a `Person`.

To change that, add `.withDirection("left")` to the pattern:

[source, javascript]
----
const pattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movieNode).related(actedIn).withDirection("left").to(people);
----

Any aspect of the pattern itself (cardinality, direction and properties) can be changed in the pattern declaration with the methods of each element in the "chain".
With these changes, the script should yield the following result:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)<-[this1:ACTED_IN]-(this2:Person)
WHERE (this0.title = $param0 AND this0.released < $param1)
RETURN this0.title, this0.tagline, this0.released
----

== Boolean operations

So far, all filters used in the examples were of the type `AND`.
For cases like these, Cypher Builder provides the shorthand method `.and` in the `WHERE` subclause.
However, filters can be used in a more advanced way, for instance with nested operations:

[source, cypher]
----
WHERE (
    a.name="Keanu Reeves" AND
    (
        NOT(m.title CONTAINS "Matrix")
        OR m.released < 2000)
    )
----

This advanced filter is composed of 3 basic comparisons:

* `a.name = "Keanu Reeves"`
* `m.title CONTAINS "Matrix"`
* `m.released < 2000`

These comparisons use the logic operations `AND`, `NOT`, and `OR`, respectivelly.

Still, as advanced queries grow, they can start to hinder maintenance.
To avoid this scenario, it is advisable to split the query into more basic comparisons and compose it afterwards.

The process is similar to how you would perform with nodes and patterns:

[source, javascript]
----
const isKeanu = Cypher.eq(personNode.property("name"), new Cypher.Param("Keanu Reeves"));
const titleContainsMatrix = Cypher.contains(titleProp, new Cypher.Param("The Matrix"));
const releasedBefore2000 = Cypher.lt(yearProp, new Cypher.Param(2000));
----

Here you can use `titleProp` and `yearProp` to xref:getting-started/filters-and-projections.adoc#_reusing_variables[reuse variables].
Alternatively, you can also make a `personName` variable for the first operation instead of passing the property directly.

To compose the comparisons with boolean operators, you need a different strategy than the `where().and()` shorthand used before.
That is because now there are nested operations (`NOT` and `OR`). 
To achieve this: 

. Use the methods `Cypher.and`, `Cypher.or`, and `Cypher.not` inside the `.where()` method:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const clause = new Cypher.Match(pattern)
    .where(Cypher.and(isKeanu, Cypher.or(Cypher.not(releasedBefore2000), titleContainsMatrix)))
    .return(titleProp, taglineProp, yearProp);
----
+
Building queries in separate variables and composing them is a good opportunity to add context to what each part means.
This helps reading advanced filtering, as the basic operations have clearer names.

. Run the script. 
The resulting Cypher should look like this:
+
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)<-[this1:ACTED_IN]-(this2:Person)
WHERE (this2.name = $param0 AND (NOT (this0.title CONTAINS $param1) OR this0.released < $param2))
RETURN this0.title, this0.tagline, this0.released
----
+
[source, javascript]
----
{ param0: 'Keanu Reeves', param1: 'The Matrix', param2: 2000 }
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure to double-check whether all variables refer to the correct param and node/relationship. 
====

== Projection aliases

Lastly, here is how you can add projection aliases:

. To return `r.roles` aliased as `actingRoles`, add `roles` to the list of properties:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const rolesProperty = actedIn.property("roles");
----

. Like before, add the property to the `.return` statement but, in this case, passing a tuple with the aliased value:
+
[source, javascript]
----
    .return(titleProp, taglineProp, yearProp, [rolesProperty, "actingRoles"]);
----

. Run the query.
The result should look like this:
+
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN this0.title, this0.tagline, this0.released, this1.roles AS actingRoles
----

== Conclusion

After going through all the steps previously described, your script should look like this:

[source, javascript]
----
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";

const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({
    labels: ["Movie"],
});

const actedIn = new Cypher.Relationship({
    type: "ACTED_IN",
});

const personNode = new Cypher.Node({
    labels: ["Person"],
});

const pattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movieNode).related(actedIn).withDirection("left").to(personNode);

const titleProp = movieNode.property("title");
const yearProp = movieNode.property("released");
const taglineProp = movieNode.property("tagline");
const rolesProperty = actedIn.property("roles");

const isKeanu = Cypher.eq(personNode.property("name"), new Cypher.Param("Keanu Reeves"));
const titleContainsMatrix = Cypher.contains(titleProp, new Cypher.Param("The Matrix"));
const releasedBefore2000 = Cypher.lt(yearProp, new Cypher.Param(2000));

const clause = new Cypher.Match(pattern)
    .where(Cypher.and(isKeanu, Cypher.or(Cypher.not(titleContainsMatrix), releasedBefore2000)))
    .return(titleProp, taglineProp, yearProp, [rolesProperty, "actingRoles"]);

const { cypher, params } = clause.build();
console.log(cypher);
console.log(params);
----

The result of executing this script should be:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)<-[this1:ACTED_IN]-(this2:Person)
WHERE (this2.name = $param0 AND (NOT (this0.title CONTAINS $param1) OR this0.released < $param2))
RETURN this0.title, this0.tagline, this0.released, this1.roles AS actingRoles
----

[source, javascript]
----
{ param0: 'Keanu Reeves', param1: 'The Matrix', param2: 2000 }
----

With this, you have learned how to build advanced queries and use `AS` to alias projections.
