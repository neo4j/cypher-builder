= Querying

This guide shows how to create a simple Cypher query to `MATCH` and `RETURN` Movies using the Cypher Builder:

```cypher
MATCH(m:Movie)
RETURN m
```

== Instructions

. Define a node variable by creating a new instance of `Cypher.Node`:
+
```javascript
const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({
  labels: ["Movie"]
});
```

. Create a `MATCH` clause and pass the node variable as an argument:
+
```javascript
const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode);
```

. To `RETURN` the Node variables, use the `.return` method in the `MATCH` clause:
+
```javascript
clause.return(movieNode);
```

.. Alternatively, you can do the same thing by creating the clause in a single statement:
+
```javascript
const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).return(movieNode);
```

. After the query is ready, it is time to build it. 
This step will generate the actual Cypher string that can be used in a Neo4j database:
+
```javascript
const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
```

== Conclusion

Altogether, your script should look like this:

```javascript
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";

const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({
  labels: ["Movie"]
});

const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).return(movieNode);

const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
```

Now, if you execute `node main.js` again, it will output the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (this0:Movie)
RETURN this0
```

[NOTE]
====
Note that `this0` is an autogenerated name for the Node variable created by the Cypher Builder.
