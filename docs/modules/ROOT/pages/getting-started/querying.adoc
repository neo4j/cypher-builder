= Querying

This page shows you how to create the following simple Cypher query to `MATCH` and `RETURN` movies using the Cypher Builder:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(m:Movie)
RETURN m
----


== Instructions

. Define a node variable by creating a new instance of `Cypher.Node`:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const movieNode = new Cypher.Node();
----

. Create the pattern to be matched against with `Cypher.Pattern`:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const matchPattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movieNode, { labels: ["Movie"] });
----


. Create a `MATCH` clause and pass the pattern as an argument:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const clause = new Cypher.Match(matchPattern);
----

. To `RETURN` the node variables, use the `.return` method in the `MATCH` clause:
+
[source, javascript]
----
clause.return(movieNode);
----

.. Alternatively, you can do the same by creating the clause with a single statement:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const clause = new Cypher.Match(matchPattern).return(movieNode);
----

. After the query is ready, it is time to build it. 
This step generates the actual Cypher string that can be used in a Neo4j database:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
----


== Conclusion

Your full script should look like this:

[source, javascript]
----
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";

const movieNode = new Cypher.Node();

const matchPattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movieNode, { labels: ["Movie"] });
const clause = new Cypher.Match(matchPattern).return(movieNode);

const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
----

If you execute `node main.js` again, it outputs the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)
RETURN this0
----

[NOTE]
====
Note that `this0` is an autogenerated name for the node variable created by the Cypher Builder.
