= Connecting to Neo4j

The Cypher Builder library helps you compose Cypher queries, but sending these to Neo4j must be done separately through a link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-driver[Neo4j driver].
This tutorial demonstrates how you can do that.


== Setup the project

. Initialize your project by following the instructions in the xref:/getting-started/installation.adoc[Installation] page.

. To connect to Neo4j, make sure you have both `@neo4j/cypher-builder` and `neo4j-driver` installed in your NodeJS project:
+
[source, cmd]
----
npm install @neo4j/cypher-builder neo4j-driver
----
+
For this example, the https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/example-data[Movies dataset] is used.
Alternatively, you can create entries with the following Cypher examples:
+
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE(:Movie {title: "The Matrix"})
CREATE(:Movie {title: "The Terminal"})
----

== Initialize the driver
Add the following lines to the JavaScript file created in the xref:/getting-started/installation.adoc[Installation] step to initialize the driver:```

I think the link to the JS manual makes it a bit confusing here because the instructions are also featured below, so if that makes sense, removing that notion can be a bit more clarifying.


[source, javascript]
----
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const driver = neo4j.driver("neo4j://localhost", neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password"));
----

== Construct your Cypher query

You can compose any query by using the Cypher object. 
For instance, this query:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node();
const query = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Pattern(movie, { labels: ["Movie"] })).return([
    movie.property("title"),
    "title",
]);
----

This will translate to:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)
RETURN this0.title AS title
----

== Execute the query

Use `.build` in the query object to generate the Cypher query and the necessary parameters to pass to `neo4j-driver`:


[source, javascript]
----
const { cypher, params } = query.build();
const { records } = await driver.executeQuery(cypher, params);
----

When you are finished, close the driver connection:

[source, javascript]
----
await driver.close();
----


== Consume the results

The `records` object can be consumed as explained in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/javascript-manual/current/transactions/[JavaScript Driver documentation]:

[source, javascript]
----
for (const record of records) {
    console.log(record.get("title"));
}
----

With the xref:getting-started/connecting-to-neo4j.adoc#_initialize_the_driver[previous example data], this should output:

[source]
----
The Matrix
The Terminal
----


== Conclusion

After following the steps here described, your script should look like this:


[source, javascript]
----
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const driver = neo4j.driver("neo4j://localhost", neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "password"));

const movie = new Cypher.Node();
const query = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Pattern(movie, { labels: ["Movie"] })).return([
    movie.property("title"),
    "title",
]);

const { cypher, params } = query.build();
const { records } = await driver.executeQuery(cypher, params);

await driver.close();

for (const record of records) {
    console.log(record.get("title"));
}
