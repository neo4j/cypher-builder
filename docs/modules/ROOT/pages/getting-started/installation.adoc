= Installation

This guide shows how to start using Cypher Builder by setting up a Node.js project with `@neo4j/cypher-builder`.

== Requirements

* link:https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] 16.0.0 or greater
* link:https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm[npm]
* **[Optional]** A link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/?ref=nav-get-started-cta[Neo4j] database to try Cypher queries.

== Instructions

. In a folder of your choice, run the following command to create a Node.js project and a `package.json` file: 
+
[source, bash]
----
npm init es6 -y
----
+
Note that these examples use ES6 modules, but CommonJS modules can be used as well.


. Install link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neo4j/cypher-builder[`@neo4j/cypher-builder`] and add it to the dependencies list with the following command: 
+
[source, cmd]
----
npm install --save @neo4j/cypher-builder
----

. Create a new file `main.js` with the following content:
+
[source, javascript]
----
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";
----

. Execute the script:
+
[source, bash]
----
node main.js
----
+
At this point, the script should not do anything, but if it doesn't show an error it means Cypher Builder has been correctly installed.
