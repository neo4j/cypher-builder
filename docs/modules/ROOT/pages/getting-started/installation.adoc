== Instructions

. In a folder of your choice, run the following command to create a Node.js project and a `package.json` file: 
+
[source, bash]
----
npm init es6 -y
----
+
Note that these examples use ES modules, but CommonJS modules can be used as well.


. Install link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neo4j/cypher-builder[`@neo4j/cypher-builder`] and add it to the dependencies list with the following command: 
+
[source, cmd]
----
npm install --save @neo4j/cypher-builder
----

. Create a new file `main.js` with the following content:

[source, javascript]
----
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";
----

. Execute the script:
+
[source, bash]
----
node main.js

At this point, the script should not do anything, but if it doesn't show an error it means Cypher Builder has been correctly installed.
