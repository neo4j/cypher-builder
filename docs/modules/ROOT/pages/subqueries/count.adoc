:description: This page describes how to create COUNT subqueries with the Cypher Builder.
= `Count`

Cypher link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/subqueries/count/[`COUNT` subqueries] can be created with `new Cypher.Count()`.
To do this, a valid query needs to be passed to `Count`. 

Note that count subqueries can also be used as predicates in `WHERE` clauses. 
For example:

[source, javascript]
----
const subquery = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] })).return("*");

const countExpr = new Cypher.Count(subquery);
const match = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Node())
    .where(Cypher.gt(countExpr, new Cypher.Literal(10)))
    .return("*");
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0)
WHERE COUNT {
    MATCH (this1:Movie)
    RETURN *
} > 10
RETURN *
----
