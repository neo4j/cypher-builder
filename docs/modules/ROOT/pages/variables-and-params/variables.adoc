:description: This page shows how to use Cypher variables in Cypher Builder.
= Variables

Variables can be used in Cypher to reference parts of a pattern and hold values.
For example:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m
----

The variable `m` refers to a node matched in the pattern `(:Movie)`. 
The node is then returned.

[NOTE]
====
Writing dynamic Cypher queries can be challenging as the resulting variables need to have unique names that correctly reference the values.
The advantage of using Cypher Builder is that JavaScript references remove the need to track variable names, thus providing another layer of abstraction.
====

== Types

Cypher Builder distinguishes four types of variables:

* *Node:* holds a reference to a node matched in a pattern.
* *Relationship:* holds a reference to a relationship in a pattern.
* *Variable:* generic variable reference.
* *Path:* a variable to hold a path.

[NOTE]
====
All Cypher Builder variables are virtual references to a Cypher variable that will be translated to a unique name.
====

== Defining a variable

An arbitrary Cypher variable can be defined with:

[source, javascript]
----
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
----

This variable can then be used as an expression in any clause that supports variables, for instance:

[source, javascript]
----
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const query = new Cypher.Return(myVar)
----

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN var0
----

The name `var0` is automatically generated when `.build()` is called, so that it prevents name collision. 
If the variable is reused, the same name will be used in the generated Cypher, for instance:

[source, javascript]
----
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const query = new Cypher.With(myVar).return(myVar);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH var0
RETURN var0
----

Each instance you create of a variable is associated with a different name:

[source, javascript]
----
const withVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const returnVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const query = new Cypher.With(withVar).return(returnVar);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH var0
RETURN var1
----

== Nodes and relationships

Nodes and relationships are sugar syntax for variables.
They can be used in xref:patterns.adoc[Patterns], for example:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node();
const relationship = new Cypher.Relationship();

const pattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movie, { labels: ["Movie"] }).related(relationship, { type: "ACTED_IN" }).to();
const match = new Cypher.Match(pattern).return(movie);
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)-[this1:ACTED_IN]->()
RETURN this0
----

In this example, the node variable `movie` is created and then used in the `MATCH` and `RETURN` clauses.

In the translated Cypher, you can see how the node variable is translated to the Cypher variable `this0`, while the relationship is assigned to `this1`. 
These names are not defined in your JavaScript code, but are automatically generated when the query is built with `.build()`. 
The labels and types passed to the `Node` and `Relationship` variables are used in the pattern.


[NOTE]
====
Passing `labels` or `type` to Nodes and Relationships is deprecated. Currently, the classes `Node` and `Relationship` are just sugar syntax for `Variables` and can be used in the same places. The only difference is that variables will be automatically named `var` while nodes and relationships will be named `this`
====

== Path

Path variables can be used for path assignment in patterns, for example:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p0 = (this1)-[this2:ACTED_IN]->(this3)
RETURN p0
----

To assign a path variable, use the method `.assignTo` in the relevant pattern and pass a `new PathVariable()` instance:

[source, javascript]
----
const path = new Cypher.PathVariable();

const query = new Cypher.Match(pattern.assignTo(path)).return(path);
----


== Named variables

By default, variables do not have a name; a unique name/id is generated at build time to avoid collisions.
However, in some cases, you may want to generate a query with a specific name. 
To do this, all variable types must have a counterpart `Named` class, for instance:

* `NamedVariable`
* `NamedNode`
* `NamedRelationship`
* `NamedPathVariable`

These can be used in the same fashion as normal variables, but a name must be provided when creating them:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.NamedNode("n");
const match = new Cypher.Match(movie, { labels: ["Movie"] }).return(movie);
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Movie)
RETURN n
----

== Properties

Variables such as nodes or maps may contain properties. 
To access these properties in the generated Cypher, you can use the method `.property` on variables:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node()
const query = new Cypher.Match(movie, { labels: ["Movie"] }).return(movie.property("title"));
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(this0:Movie)
RETURN this0.title
----

=== Nested properties

Nested properties can also be accessed either by passing multiple parameters or concatenating calls to `.property`:

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.Variable().property("movie", "title");
new Cypher.Variable().property("movie").property("title")
----

In both cases, the resulting Cypher should look like this:

[source, cypher]
----
var0.movie.title
----

=== Expressions

Expressions can also be used as a property key to dynamically access properties:

[source, javascript]
----
const movie = new Cypher.Node()

const movieProperty = movie.property(Cypher.plus(new Cypher.Param("ti"), new Cypher.Literal("tle")))
const query = new Cypher.Match(movie, { labels: ["Movie"] }).return(movieProperty);
----

The query automatically adds square brackets (`[]`) notation to safely execute the expression:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH(this0:Movie)
RETURN this0[($param0 + $param1)]
----

=== Index

Like properties, an index can also be accessed through the method `.index`:

[source, javascript]
----
new Cypher.Variable().index(2);
----

[source, cypher]
----
var0[2]
----
