= Cypher Builder

Cypher Builder is a programmatic API for building link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/[Cypher] queries for Neo4j in JavaScript and TypeScript.

For example, the following code:

[source, javascript]
----
const movieNode = new Cypher.Node();
const pattern = new Cypher.Pattern(movieNode, { labels: ["Movie"] });

const matchQuery = new Cypher.Match(pattern)
    .where(movieNode, {
        title: new Cypher.Param("The Matrix"),
    })
    .return(movieNode.property("title"));

const { cypher, params } = matchQuery.build();
----

Generates the following Cypher query and any required parameters:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:Movie)
WHERE this0.title = $param0
RETURN this0.title
----
