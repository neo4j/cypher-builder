Deprecate `.children` from `CompositeClause` generated from `utils.concat` with no replacement.

The clauses generated by `utils.concat` provide a public property `.children` that exposes the internals of the CompositeClause as well as the internal type `CypherASTNode`:

```js
const query = Cypher.utils.concat(clause, returnClause);
const children = query.children; // Has 2 elements of type CypherASTNode
```

Using this method as part of query building can lead to incorrect behaviour and it is generally a bad practice.
